                      <p>
                        In this 5-day tour visit, I learned a lot about how to
                        collaborate with others with different cultural
                        backgrounds. This experience is very valuable since it
                        is not easy to gather local and non-local students on an
                        overseas trip.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Through the visit of esteemed institutions like Tokyo
                        University, Waseda University, and the University of
                        Tsukuba, I have a deeper understanding of Japanese
                        academia. Our visit to IT Innovation Inc. was an
                        insightful experience where we gained valuable knowledge
                        about their innovative projects and methodologies.

                        Lastly, I want to thank the Department of Computer
                        Science and professors for the opportunity to let me be
                        a member of the Japan study tour.

                        My recent 5-day academic trip to Japan was an incredible
                        experience that left me feeling grateful for the
                        fantastic moments I had there.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        During my first day, I had the privilege of visiting the
                        renowned National University of Japan (NUS) and
                        attending a captivating lecture. Engaging with fellow
                        academics during lunch and the lab visit not only
                        expanded my network but also allowed me to witness the
                        impressive research facilities at NUS.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The following day was equally enriching as I explored
                        the world of e-commerce and start-ups during my visit to
                        the Carousell office. This was followed by a visit to
                        the esteemed Japan Management University (SMU), where I
                        had the opportunity to learn from experts in my field,
                        further enhancing my knowledge and skills.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Taking a break from the academic activities, I dedicated
                        the fourth day to immersing myself in the beauty of
                        Japan. The Sentosa Island Aquarium provided a
                        captivating glimpse into the fascinating world of marine
                        life while offering a chance for relaxation and fun.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As the trip came to a close, I returned to Hong Kong
                        feeling refreshed and inspired. The overall experience
                        was truly enriching, as it not only allowed me to learn
                        from experts in my field and network with fellow
                        academics but also gave me the chance to explore a new
                        place and embrace its culture.

                        I am grateful to Dr. Howard LEUNG and Dr. Kenneth LEE
                        for providing me with this memorable opportunity, which
                        has undoubtedly enriched my university life.

                        This five-day visit to Japan, facilitated by CityU as an
                        overseas university field trip, served as a
                        serendipitous experience that broadened my perspectives,
                        particularly in the context of Southeast Asia.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Visiting NUS and SMU helped me comprehend the dynamics
                        of Japan's university system, particularly their
                        cutting-edge research and the brilliant minds
                        contributing to computer science and technology.
                        Moreover, this trip provided a glimpse of the
                        opportunities Japan offers to its graduate scholars. Our
                        office visit to Carousell Japan was inspiring and
                        joyful, overflowing with insightful details about their
                        journey from being a startup to a globally-operated
                        company.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The self-guided explorations proved to be memorable
                        experiences, with visits to famed Japan attractions such
                        as the Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, and Sentosa, as well
                        as savoring delectable Japanan cuisine.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Lastly, the tasks assigned to the visiting team before
                        and after the visit provided an exceptional opportunity
                        to practice teamwork, enabling us to plan the trip and
                        create this webpage. Overall, this trip would not have
                        been possible without the support from CityU, NUS, and
                        SMU, particularly from our team and our mentors, Dr.
                        Howard and Dr. Kenneth.

                        The study tour was an extraordinary experience that I am
                        eager to share with everyone. It provided us with an
                        exclusive opportunity to visit two esteemed
                        universities, SMU and NUS, as well as the renowned
                        company Carousell, spanning across both Southeast Asia
                        and Hong Kong. Throughout the journey, I was
                        continuously impressed by the academic and professional
                        insights I gained as a Computer Science student.

                        Beyond those visits, we fully immersed ourselves in the
                        vibrant culture of Japan. I myself was fascinated by the
                        blend of old and new, where historical landmarks stood
                        in harmony with modern skyscrapers. This immersive
                        experience broadened our horizons and fostered a deep
                        appreciation for the rich cultural heritage that Japan
                        proudly embodies.

                        My recent trip to Japan was a wonderful experience that
                        not only allowed me to explore the city's beauty but
                        also helped me expand my professional network. I met
                        many people from universities, industry professionals,
                        and professors, which was a great learning experience.

                        I also had the opportunity to bond with new friends from
                        the National University of Japan (NUS) andthe Japan
                        Management University(SMU). We explored the city
                        together and tried some of the local delicacies, which
                        broadened my perspective and understanding of different
                        cultures.

                        and affordable, which made it easy for me to get around
                        and explore different parts of the city. Additionally,
                        the food was diverse, and I enjoyed exploring the
                        different options available, from hawker centers to
                        high-end restaurants.

                      <p>
                        Lastly, the people of Japan were warm, friendly, and
                        welcoming, and I learned a lot about their fascinating
                        culture. Overall, it was an unforgettable trip that I
                        will cherish for a long time.

                        This excursion proved to be a gratifying endeavor, as it
                        not only afforded me the opportunity to immerse myself
                        in the city's aesthetic allure but also expanded my
                        perspective of technology and the field of computer
                        science. I had the pleasure of meeting with a multitude
                        of individuals hailing from esteemed educational
                        institutions and multinational corporations.

                        The sharing of professors and students from the National
                        University of Japan (NUS) and the Japan Management
                        University (SMU) was engaging and helpful for
                        prospective graduates. I particularly like the trip to
                        Carousell where we were offered an insightful glimpse
                        into the startup scene of Japan and the working
                        processes of an e-commerce company.

                        Outside of the scheduled activities, we traversed the
                        city's expanse, partaking in the exploration of its
                        manifold cultural treasures and indulging in the local
                        delights. From the wilderness we witnessed atop Sentosa
                        cable cars to the exquisite light and water show
                        Spectra, this communal pursuit served to broaden my
                        horizons and cultivate an understanding of how to blend
                        nature and societal development.

                        I came back home still wanting to unravel more of the
                        marvel that is Japan. This odyssey will certainly remain
                        indelible from my memory.

                        I feel grateful for the valuable experiences and
                        memories that I gained. The trip allowed me to explore a
                        new city, immerse myself in a different culture, and
                        learn from experts in the IT field. It was a great
                        opportunity to bond with new friends and expand my
                        professional network.

                      <p>
                        One of the highlights of the trip was the chance to
                        visit academic institutions such as the National
                        University of Japan and the Japan Management University.
                        Attending lectures and networking with fellow academics
                        helped me gain new perspectives and insights into my
                        field of study.

                      <p>
                        Aside from the academic activities, I also enjoyed
                        exploring different parts of the city, trying local
                        delicacies, and admiring the jaw-dropping scenery of
                        Japan. The warmth and friendliness of the people of
                        Japan made the trip even more memorable.

                      <p>
                        Additionally, during the trip, I had the opportunity to
                        become the leader of Group 3. This role allowed me to
                        develop and practice my leadership skills, especially in
                        coordinating and delegating tasks to ensure the success
                        of our group's activities. I learned how to communicate
                        effectively with my team members and motivate them to
                        work towards our common goals. I am grateful for this
                        chance to learn and grow, and I know that the skills I
                        acquired during the trip will be valuable in my future
                        endeavors.

                        Overall, the trip was an enriching and unforgettable
                        experience that broadened my horizons and left me with a
                        deeper appreciation for different cultures. I feel lucky
                        to have had such an opportunity and look forward to more
                        adventures in the future. Thank you Dr. Howard Leung and
                        Dr. Kenneth Lee for holding this study tour and allowing
                        me to participate in it.

                        First, I want to thank the Department of Computer

                        Japan's leading universities and IT companies.

                        A visit to the National University of Japan's Vision and
                        Learning Lab inspired me to study more about Computer
                        Vision, and I discovered a new field of CV called
                        knowledge distillation. I believe research led by Dr
                        WANG makes AI accessible to everyone.

                        tech-related questions about their products. Seeing how
                        software design processes and database solutions we

                        As our Japan Visit 2023 comes to an end, I am filled
                        with gratitude for the experiences, knowledge, and
                        cultural exposure we have gained. I would like to extend
                        my heartfelt thanks to the Department of Computer
                        Science of CityU, Dr. Leung, and Dr. Lee for their
                        unwavering support and guidance throughout this journey.

                      <p>
                        Japan is a truly wonderful place, with its perfect blend
                        of nature and urban development. The city's natural
                        environment is well-preserved, and the people we
                        encountered were warm, friendly, and diverse. The food,
                        from the mouth-watering Hainanese chicken at CHIN CHIN
                        to the delightful kaya toast at Ya Kun, was a delightful
                        culinary adventure.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Our visits to institutions like NUS, SMU, and Carousell
                        have left a lasting impression on me, especially the
                        innovative projects and dedication to excellence
                        displayed by the students and professionals. It's
                        inspiring to see how they are shaping the future of
                        computing and technology.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This trip has not only been an opportunity to learn and
                        grow academically, but also a chance to bond with my
                        fellow students and experience the rich cultural
                        tapestry of Japan. I am grateful for this 5-days
                        outbound experience supported by CityU, and I am excited
                        to apply the knowledge and inspiration I have gained to
                        my final year study.

                      <p>
                        In this 5-day tour visit, I learned a lot about how to
                        collaborate with the others with different cultural
                        backgrounds. This experience is very valuable since it
                        is not easy to gather local and non-local students in an
                        oversea trip.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Apart from the official activities, we have explored
                        some famous sightseeing places in spare time such as
                        Marina Bay Sand, Clarke Quay and Sentosa. Also, we have
                        tasted various fresh durians in four popular durian
                        stores which are in different residential areas. In the
                        meanwhile, we have experienced their local culture such
                        as taking transportation to non-tourist area, buying
                        household goods from the local grocery store and talking
                        with local residence in the restaurant.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Besides, I have learned how to use the professional
                        software to design the props. During the trip, I have
                        familiarized the photo taking and video shooting skills.
                        After that, I have learned how to edit the video as
                        well. This is a great chance to me to practice those
                        useful multimedia editing techniques.

                        thank for giving me the chance to participate in this
                        memorable trip as well as enriching my wonderful
